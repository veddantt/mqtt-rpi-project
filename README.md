# Raspberry Pi MQTT Project

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project demonstrates how to set up a Raspberry Pi as an MQTT client to publish and subscribe messages using the **Mosquitto broker** and **MQTT Explorer**.  
It also includes an IoT sensing application where temperature & humidity values are read from a **DHT11 sensor** and transmitted via MQTT.  

## ðŸ“‚ Contents
- **Programming_file.pdf** â†’ Detailed project report with setup, code, and results.  
- **MQTT_Steps.txt** â†’ Step-by-step guide for installing Mosquitto, configuring Raspberry Pi, and testing with MQTT Explorer.  

## ðŸš€ Key Features
- Raspberry Pi as MQTT publisher and subscriber  
- Laptop/PC with MQTT Explorer for testing  
- Python client (publisher & subscriber) using `paho-mqtt`  
- DHT11 sensor integration  

## ðŸ”® Future Work
- Add more sensors/actuators  
- Connect to cloud platforms (AWS IoT, Azure IoT Hub)  
- Create real-time dashboards
